# "Template: Your Family Migration Story" 
  <!-Use the same title that you used above for this intro section-->


Replace this text with your 2-3 sentence introduction to your family migration story. Identify the 3 key elements of this story major events, historical developments, and/or objects (WHEN WHERE WHAT WHO), that illustrate WHY AND HOW your famiy's migration story relates to US history and patterns of migration in US history. This is your overall thesis for your family migration story.  Try to use accessible language that a high schooler can understand. 100-150 words. 


## SUBHEADER 1 that frames historical context and impacts
 

This section should be 150-250 words. Explain how your family's migration story relates to the U.S. history of migration.  What broader economnic, political, or social developments at the time and in the particular original location motivated your family to geographically relocate? Was this a voluntary or involuntary relocation? Name and explain the specific economic, poitical, or social developments that contributed to your family's decision to choose a particular destination.  

 Remember to use multiple paragraphs that each have a particular focus and begin with a topic sentence that states the focus. The remaining sentences should include examples from secondary sources that are academically peer-reviewed. Be sure to cite both your primary (oral history) and secondary sources (class materials) properly.


## SUBHEADER 2 that frames personal context and impacts

{% capture historical_context_and_impacts %}
This section should be 150-200 words. Draw from your oral history to explain the personal reasons for your family's movement to a different geographic location. If the relocation took place under pressure or coercion, that still might explain the personal decision to move. What were the personal push factors (motivations to leave)? Were there any personal pull factors (motivations to move to a particular destination)? Was there any evidence of chain migration (family/community connections that provided support, jobs, familiar culture)? 
 
Be sure to break up your text into topical paragraphs.  Note that you will complete this paragraph after the audio clip and optional pull quote below. 
{% endcapture %}
{% include media/audio.html
  src="/assets/audio/interview.mp3"
%}
<!--replace "interview.mp3 with the 1-2 minute audio clip from your family oral history that highlights the reasons for your family's migration. Make sure this quote relates to what you have written for this section. This clip should be an mp3 that you upload under assets/audio-->  
{% include typography/pullquote.html text="\"You may use this pull quote feature to visually highlight a key phrase or sentence from the oral history audio clip you have uploaded to the site.\"" %}

Conclude the section about personal context and impacts here. 


## Subheader 3 that frames your midterm assignment 
<!--be sure to address any instructor feedback about your midterm assignment when you include it in this final project -->

{% capture midterm_assignment %}
Here you will want to include all or part of your midterm assignment. Be sure to provide transitions so that it fits in with your final project., and clarify how this component is part of your family migration story.

 Choose what photo, video, or image you will include for this section. For an object:  If you wrote about a song, you may want to include a youtube of the song, or if you wrote about a family recipe, you may want to include a high quality image of the particular dish or recipe card. For the journey:  If you wrote about actual migration experience, you may want to include a photograph of the journey, the site of origin, or destination site; or you may want to include a map with the physical route highlighted. For identity and place in US society: you may wish to include an image of a place or object, or a video that best captures the experience described in the oral history. 
{% endcapture %}

{% include images/figure-wrap.html
  image-path="images/figure_2.jpg"
  image-position="right"
  image-width="45%"
  caption="Include a caption for the photo, video, or image and provide credit for the image."
  text=midterm_assignment_text
%}
<!--figure-wrap.html will place your visual object side by side with your text.  You may copy the code above to include an audio clip, or you may use embed codes from YouTube if you wish to include a video clip, or you may upload a high quality .jpg or .png to the image folder to include an image -->

## Subheader 4: frame how your family's migration story relates to the migration stories addressed in class 

125-175 words. How does your family's personal migration story relate to the migration stories we have addressed in class? Be sure to note specific ways the stories relate to each other.  Note that you may also identify key themes and cite specific examples from multiple class materials that evidence those themes.  Be sure to cite the references you rely on when you discuss these other stories.

 {include images/figure-wrap.html
  image-path="images/figure_3.jpg"
  image-position="left"
  image-width="30%"
  caption="Include caption and credit for the image."}
  <!--upload figure_3.jpg to assets/images OR you may create a carousel of images if you have them about your family's migration history using this code below
  {% assign images_list = "images/carousel_1.jpg,images/carousel_2.jpg,images/carousel_3.jpg" | split: ',' %}
{% include images/carousel.html id="chile-types" images=images_list %}-->


## Conclusion 

{% include typography/pullquote.html text="\"You can insert a key reflection about what you have learned researching family migration history or what you have learned about US migration history as a result of documenting your family's migration history.\"" %} 
70-85 words. Conclude your project with your personal reflections about what you have learned as a result of this final project. You might address what you have learned about family members, family, migration, and/or U.S. history and society.
